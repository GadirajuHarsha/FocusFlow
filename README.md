# FocusFlow

Desktop application that interfaces with webcam-based eye-tracking software to monitor a userâ€™s visual attention during on-screen tasks. The application will quantify specific gaze patterns related to focus versus distraction and present this information through post-session reports and subtle real-time cues, enabling users to gain insights into their attentional habits. Intended primarily for single-monitor use.
